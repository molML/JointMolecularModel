These are several metric used to approximate the complexity of a molecule from different angles.

# 	1.	BertzCT: Captures structural branching and connectivity.
#   2.  BÃ¶ttcher Complexity: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00723
# 	2.	Shannon Entropy of the molecular graph: Measures the structural disorder and diversity of the molecule.
# 	3.	Shannon Entropy of the SMILES string: Measures the structural disorder and diversity of SMILES.
# 	5.	Number of structural motifs: Assesses the chemical diversity and functional complexity.
